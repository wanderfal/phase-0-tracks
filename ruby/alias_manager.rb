# We first take the given name and swap the positions
# of the First name, and last name.
#
# Then we first find all the vowels (a,e,i,o,u) within the names
# and change them to the next vowel (a,e,i,o,u), so if you have 'u'
# it will change to an 'a'.
#
# After the vowels have been changed, we then go through
# all the other characters and change them to the next
# character.
