# 2-Player Game
# Player 1 will provide the game with the word
# Player 2 will have a limited number of guesses based on the word's length
# Only unique guesses will count towards the limit
#
# After Player 1 provides the input, Player 2 will see placeholder
# characters indicating the amount of characters in the word. Like:
# "_ _ _ _ _".
#
# Player 2 is allowed single character guesses. If the characer is
# found in the word, then it will replace the placeholder. Aside from
# single character guesses, all other input must be exactly equal to
# the word or phrase.
