# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - It allows us to see the changes that are made to files and then if we choose to, we can merge these revisions made by different people. On projects that require input from multiple people, version control helps with coordinating the proposed changes and putting together the final draft of the project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch allows us to make revisions to the actual file without committing; that is we can make sure we want those changes before we make it permanent.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is when we decide that the revisions/changes that have been made in the branches are changes that we want in our final product. A good commit message is short and clear about the changes that have been made.
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict usually occurs when there is an attempt to merge multiple branches that have different files and/or differently modified files. Such as when one branch has deleted a line in a file, while in another branch, that same line edited to something different. This results in a conflict between the two files, and Git does not know which change it should make.
