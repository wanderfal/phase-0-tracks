1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
    - Open Sourced
    - This means that anyone with an interest in the operating system can contribute and add to it. It also means that you can do whatever you want to the system.
    - LINUX is a free distribution of the UNIX operating system, which shares the same philosophies.
    - The LINUX operating system contains simple tools that perform limited, but well-defined functions.

2. In your own words, what is a VPS(virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
    - A VPS is an isolated system, like a sandbox. In that isolated system you can do anything you want to it, and it will always remain within that isolated space. You can also set up the resources that the isolated space takes within your own machine. It is like a machine inside of a machine.
    - You can test anything you want without risking any kind of damage to your own machine. This allows us to experiment however we want.

3. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
    - The main reason for not  running programs as a root user is because of security.
    - The root user gains the powers to do anything to the system, such as formatting the entire computer.
    - By running as a root user, it increases the chances significantly of causing permanent damage to your system.
    - No one should have that much power.
